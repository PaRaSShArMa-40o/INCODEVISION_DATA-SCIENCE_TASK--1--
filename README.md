# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing Pipeline

This repository contains my internship Task-1 project focused on building a complete **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Pipeline** using a raw CSV dataset.

The goal of this task was to transform messy, real-world data into a clean, structured, and analysis-ready format — which is one of the most critical steps in any data science or machine learning workflow.

## 📌 Project Overview

Real-world datasets are rarely clean. They usually contain:

- Missing values  
- Duplicate records  
- Inconsistent formats  
- Invalid entries  

In this project, I designed a pipeline that automatically:

✔ Handles missing values  
✔ Removes duplicate records  
✔ Fixes inconsistent formats (age, gender, dates, emails, city names)  
✔ Resolves email conflicts  
✔ Generates cleaned datasets  
✔ Produces a structured cleaning report  

The final output is a ready-to-use dataset suitable for further analysis or modeling.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy

## 📂 Dataset Issues Addressed

The raw CSV dataset contained:

- Null / empty values  
- Duplicate rows  
- Mixed date formats  
- Inconsistent gender labels  
- Invalid email formats  
- City name variations  
- Conflicting email entries  

Each of these problems was systematically detected and corrected.

## ⚙️ Pipeline Workflow

1. Load raw CSV data  
2. Identify missing values  
3. Handle null entries using appropriate strategies  
4. Remove duplicate records  
5. Standardize formats (age, gender, dates, emails, cities)  
6. Resolve conflicting email data  
7. Generate:

   - Cleaned dataset  
   - Data cleaning report

## 📊 Outputs

After running the pipeline, the following files are generated:

- ✅ Cleaned CSV dataset  
- ✅ Data cleaning summary report  

These outputs are structured and ready for downstream tasks like visualization, analytics, or machine learning.
